Our Strategic Pillars: Driving Holistic Development
HGSI's impactful work is structured around three interconnected strategic pillars. These pillars represent our commitment to fostering comprehensive, sustainable development, addressing the root causes of poverty, and building resilient communities. Each pillar is supported by targeted program areas designed for maximum impact and measurable outcomes.
PILLAR 1: Empowering Men and Women with Sustainable Livelihoods
This pillar is dedicated to fostering economic independence and resilience among adults in marginalized communities. We aim to equip men and women with the essential skills, knowledge, and resources needed to generate sustainable income and uplift their households through                    Peer-to-peer mentorship programs, vocational and Financial Literacy training, business Mentorship and Seed funding
PILLAR 2: Enhancing Access to Quality Education for All Children in Marginalized Communities
This pillar focuses on ensuring that every child, regardless of gender or circumstance, has access to quality education and a nurturing learning environment, laying the foundation for a brighter future through our PLE Empowerment Project dubbed “A bright future begins with a book”, the  “1K Project” peer-funding model in schools, Man of Tomorrow our boy Mentorship Program, distribution and training on making of reusable Sanitary pads and strengthening learning with extracurricular and holistic support.
PILLAR 3: Strengthening Community Development Through Infrastructure Improvement
This pillar aims to enhance the overall well-being and resilience of communities by improving access to essential services through sustainable infrastructure development like supporting construction of clean water systems, sanitation facilities and provision of renewable energy solutions.
 
Our History
Our Story:
"It started, as so many profound things do, with a simple, almost forgotten place: Murambo village. Our family’s roots there had seemed to wither after we lost loved ones. Why return when the heart of our connection is gone? But a casual family chat, a reunion in a WhatsApp group, sparked a question that refused to be silenced: What about the family we didn't know? The relatives still in Murambo, perhaps struggling?
That question led to action, beginning with the local primary school. There were only seven P7 students, desperate for scholastic materials and revision guides. We dipped into our own pockets, a small gesture that yielded a huge return: the undeniable sparkle of hope in those children's eyes. We knew then, with absolute clarity, this couldn’t be a one-off. It had to be bigger. It had to be sustainable.
So, we registered a social enterprise, establishing the foundational structure and operational framework to scale our initial impact responsibly. Not just for Murambo, but because we saw the universal truth in those seven children’s faces: every child, everywhere, deserves a chance. From that red dust, a profound belief blossomed – that compassion knows no borders, and a helping hand can reach across villages, across countries, and the world. Our journey began with family, extended to a village, and now, it’s a commitment to fostering hope and opportunity wherever it's needed most.

Nabukalu Diana: The Founding Catalyst
Chairperson, Co-Founder & CEO
Nabukalu Diana is the Founding Catalyst behind Huruma Global Support Initiative (HGSI). Her journey began with a quiet ache—witnessing children and families brimming with unfulfilled potential, weighed down not by a lack of ability but by a lack of opportunity. What began as empathy grew into a powerful conviction: that compassion must be translated into action—strategic, persistent, and deeply rooted in dignity.
Nabukalu believes that real change goes beyond acts of charity; it demands bold, sustainable solutions that restore hope and unlock the human spirit. From that realization, the seed of HGSI was planted in her heart and has since grown into a vibrant movement—one that now supports communities through education, empowerment, and practical support.
Today, Nabukalu continues to lead HGSI with passion and clarity. She is the relentless force behind our vision, daring to imagine—and build—a world where every child and every family has a real chance to thrive.
“Empathy must evolve into strategy. Dignity is not given it is restored. And that is the work of HGSI.”
