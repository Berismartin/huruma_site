Our History
Our Story:
"It started, as so many profound things do, with a simple, almost forgotten place: Murambo village. Our family’s roots there had seemed to wither after we lost loved ones. Why return when the heart of our connection is gone? But a casual family chat, a reunion in a WhatsApp group, sparked a question that refused to be silenced: What about the family we didn't know? The relatives still in Murambo, perhaps struggling?
That question led to action, beginning with the local primary school. There were only seven P7 students, desperate for scholastic materials and revision guides. We dipped into our own pockets, a small gesture that yielded a huge return: the undeniable sparkle of hope in those children's eyes. We knew then, with absolute clarity, this couldn’t be a one-off. It had to be bigger. It had to be sustainable.
So, we registered a social enterprise, establishing the foundational structure and operational framework to scale our initial impact responsibly. Not just for Murambo, but because we saw the universal truth in those seven children’s faces: every child, everywhere, deserves a chance. From that red dust, a profound belief blossomed – that compassion knows no borders, and a helping hand can reach across villages, across countries, and the world. Our journey began with family, extended to a village, and now, it’s a commitment to fostering hope and opportunity wherever it's needed most.

Beyond the Books: A Glimpse into Hope and Heartbreak at 
Murambo Catholic Nursery and Primary School 
A Story of Urgent Need and Unyielding Spirit 
 
The air buzzed with anticipation. Our team at Huruma Global Support Initiative (HGSI) 
was on its way to Murambo Catholic Nursery and Primary School in Rukungiri District, 
carrying boxes filled with hope. Our "A Bright Future Begins with a Book" campaign 
was a pilot, a simple yet powerful idea: provide essential PLE question paper banks, 
pens, pencils, erasers, mathematical sets, and rulers to Primary Leaving Examination 
(PLE) candidates. We imagined the smiles, the renewed determination. This was our 
first step, a small but vital lifeline for children in a community where education often 
remains an unreachable dream. 
As we arrived, the warmth of the welcome was immediate. A well-arranged tent and a 
special sitting area; The Headmistress, teachers (11 in total), and pupils (175 in total) 
 
 
greeted us with genuine smiles, their gratitude palpable, the school choir sang, the 
nursery children rhyming, the LC1 chairperson, School Management Committee, the 
PTA and the parents to the P7 candidates all in anticipation of the hope we carried. We 
gathered the 15 PLE candidates – our initial target of 21 had sadly dwindled, with 6 
bright students already forced to drop out due to lack of school fees, registration costs, 
and basic scholastic materials. It was a sobering reminder of the very real barriers we 
sought to address. Yet, as we handed over the package, we carried containing the 
neatly packed pencil cases, mathematical sets, foot rulers, pens, pencils and the 
precious past papers, the light in those children's eyes and the relief in the struggling 
parents sigh was undeniable. A grateful headmistress, a relieved class teacher... A small 
victory, a moment of pure joy. 
But then, the tour began. And our smiles turned to shock, then to a profound, aching 
sadness that settled deep in our hearts. 
We stepped into the P1 classroom, meant for 18 eager young minds. What we found 
was unimaginable. This single, incomplete room, with its bare dirt floor and just four 
rough benches made from logs – benches that would surely hurt a child’s back – 
served not only as a learning space but also as the staff room for 11 teachers. Tucked 
behind the door, a makeshift shelf overflowed with papers, topped incongruously with 
two deflated soccer balls. This was the Headmistress's "office," a low-level table and a 
hard wooden chair. And in another corner, sacks of maize flour, beans, and three 
cartons of soda sat, turning the classroom into the school's food storage. The thought 
of children trying to learn, teachers trying to prepare lessons, and a Headmistress 
trying to manage a school in such a cramped, multi-purpose, and undignified space 
was heartbreaking. 
The horror continued. The P3 classroom, we discovered, doubled as the school kitchen. 
A huge pile of firewood dominated one corner. A few plastic plates and cups, clearly 
not enough for 175 children, lay on a tarpaulin on the dirt floor. Soot marks stained the 
walls around a makeshift cooking area, with discarded jerricans littering the side. We 
pictured the smoke, the heat, the constant disruption to learning. In another corner, a 
pile of children’s bags – woven baskets, really – held their few precious books, some 
with a single container or two for their meagre meals. Above us, an incomplete ceiling 
stared down, and wooden window frames, too few to fill all the openings, offered little 
protection against the elements or intruders.  
Then came the P4 classroom. Our hearts truly broke here. No windows, no doors, a dirt 
 
 
floor, no ceiling. The roof was only partially complete, offering a mere suggestion of 
shelter from sun or rain. Broken blackboards stood as silent witnesses to interrupted 
lessons. Five dilapidated, makeshift seats attached to desks, again made from raw logs, 
looked more like crude furniture from a local drinking spot than a place for children to 
learn. These were meant for 28 students but were clearly insufficient. How could a child 
study, how could they even write an exam, at such a desk? The indignity was crushing. 
The tour revealed deeper systemic failures. There were no latrine facilities at the 
school. We wondered where the pupils, especially the young girls who need this dignity 
most during their monthly periods and who cannot even afford sanitary towels, went 
to ease themselves. The teachers, we learned, walked five hundred meters uphill to a 
dilapidated latrine at a nearby Catholic church. There was no running water within the 
school grounds; water was fetched from a borehole over 1 kilometre down the valley. 
We saw pupils walking barefoot, their uniforms so old, worn, and torn that it was painful 
to witness. 
The lack of basic resources extended to learning aids. No electricity, no printers, no 
electronic devices. Teachers had to rely on well-wishers to transport and print end-of
term exams from Rukungiri town. The school had no atlas, leaving us to imagine how 
geography was taught; perhaps from memory, prone to error. Crucially, there was no 
dictionary in the entire school. Our hearts sank when we saw the word "Magnet" 
misspelled as "mangnent" on a science teacher's board in the P7 classroom – a small 
detail that spoke volumes about the daily struggle to access basic reference tools. 
The teachers, the very backbone of this struggling institution? They had been unpaid 
for over 5 months. Yet, day after day, they returned, driven by an unwavering 
commitment to these children. A quick inquiry revealed that the meagre fees paid by 
pupils (UGX 28,000 per term), which many families couldn't even afford, were 
insufficient to sustain the school or pay salaries. They too relied on well-wishers. Even 
the 50,000 that was left behind by one of our colleagues wasn’t enough to cover the 
salary dues of the school cook who continuously reminded us that her needs are also 
overwhelming and should not be forgotten. 
Despite this overwhelming despair, a flicker of hope remained. The dedication of the 
PTA, the School Management Committee, and the parents, enduring immense 
hardships, was inspiring. The teachers' resilience, showing up daily despite being 
unpaid, was a testament to their profound commitment. 
The "A Bright Future Begins with a Book" pilot, while a success for the 15 children who 
received materials, was a stark awakening. It showed us that while books are a start, 
the very foundation of education is crumbling for countless children in places like 
Murambo Catholic Nursery and Primary School. If a simple pencil and a past paper 
could bring such joy and a glimmer of hope, imagine the transformative power of a safe 
classroom, clean water, dignified sanitation, and supported teachers. 
This is not an isolated incident. Across Uganda, several schools face similar, unseen 
struggles. We must not let this talent go to waste. The success of our pilot, coupled 
with the profound needs uncovered, compels us to act on a larger scale. We are driven 
to expand our holistic support to three other equally deserving, marginalized 
schools across Uganda. We believe that by addressing these fundamental barriers, 
we can ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has the chance to truly 
build a bright future. We invite you to join us in this urgent and vital mission.
