potential and contribute meaningfully to their communities, shaping a more
prosperous tomorrow for everyone.

essential skills, resources, and unwavering confidence to lead fulfilling
lives and passionately pursue their dreams.

potential is fully unleashed, every child's future shines brightly, and the

Our Strategic Pillars: Driving Holistic Development
HGSI's impactful work is structured around three interconnected strategic
pillars. These pillars represent our commitment to fostering comprehensive,
sustainable development, addressing the root causes of poverty, and
building resilient communities. Each pillar is supported by targeted program
areas designed for maximum impact and measurable outcomes.

PILLAR 1: Empowering Men and Women with Sustainable Livelihoods
This pillar is dedicated to fostering economic independence and resilience
among adults in marginalized communities. We aim to equip men and
women with the essential skills, knowledge, and resources needed to
generate sustainable income and uplift their households through
Peer-to-peer mentorship programs, vocational and Financial Literacy
training, business Mentorship and Seed funding
PILLAR 2: Enhancing Access to Quality Education for All Children in
Marginalized Communities
This pillar focuses on ensuring that every child, regardless of gender or
circumstance, has access to quality education and a nurturing learning
environment, laying the foundation for a brighter future through our PLE
Empowerment Project dubbed “A bright future begins with a book”, the “1K
Project” peer-funding model in schools, Man of Tomorrow our boy
Mentorship Program, distribution and training on making of reusable
Sanitary pads and strengthening learning with extracurricular and holistic
support.
PILLAR 3: Strengthening Community Development Through
Infrastructure Improvement
This pillar aims to enhance the overall well-being and resilience of
communities by improving access to essential services through sustainable
infrastructure development like supporting construction of clean water
systems, sanitation facilities and provision of renewable energy solutions.

Our History
Our Story:
"It started, as so many profound things do, with a simple, almost forgotten place: Murambo
village. Our family’s roots there had seemed to wither after we lost loved ones. Why return when
the heart of our connection is gone? But a casual family chat, a reunion in a WhatsApp group,
sparked a question that refused to be silenced: What about the family we didn't know? The
relatives still in Murambo, perhaps struggling?

That question led to action, beginning with the local primary school. There were only seven P7
students, desperate for scholastic materials and revision guides. We dipped into our own
pockets, a small gesture that yielded a huge return: the undeniable sparkle of hope in those
children's eyes. We knew then, with absolute clarity, this couldn’t be a one-off. It had to be
bigger. It had to be sustainable.
So, we registered a social enterprise, establishing the foundational structure and operational
framework to scale our initial impact responsibly. Not just for Murambo, but because we saw the
universal truth in those seven children’s faces: every child, everywhere, deserves a chance.
From that red dust, a profound belief blossomed – that compassion knows no borders, and a
helping hand can reach across villages, across countries, and the world. Our journey began with
family, extended to a village, and now, it’s a commitment to fostering hope and opportunity
wherever it's needed most.

Beyond the Books: A Glimpse into Hope and Heartbreak at
Murambo Catholic Nursery and Primary School
A Story of Urgent Need and Unyielding Spirit

The air buzzed with anticipation. Our team at Huruma Global Support Initiative (HGSI)
was on its way to Murambo Catholic Nursery and Primary School in Rukungiri District,
carrying boxes filled with hope. Our "A Bright Future Begins with a Book" campaign
was a pilot, a simple yet powerful idea: provide essential PLE question paper banks,
pens, pencils, erasers, mathematical sets, and rulers to Primary Leaving Examination
(PLE) candidates. We imagined the smiles, the renewed determination. This was our
first step, a small but vital lifeline for children in a community where education often
remains an unreachable dream.
As we arrived, the warmth of the welcome was immediate. A well-arranged tent and a
special sitting area; The Headmistress, teachers (11 in total), and pupils (175 in total)

greeted us with genuine smiles, their gratitude palpable, the school choir sang, the
nursery children rhyming, the LC1 chairperson, School Management Committee, the
PTA and the parents to the P7 candidates all in anticipation of the hope we carried. We
gathered the 15 PLE candidates – our initial target of 21 had sadly dwindled, with 6
bright students already forced to drop out due to lack of school fees, registration costs,
and basic scholastic materials. It was a sobering reminder of the very real barriers we
sought to address. Yet, as we handed over the package, we carried containing the
neatly packed pencil cases, mathematical sets, foot rulers, pens, pencils and the
precious past papers, the light in those children's eyes and the relief in the struggling
parents sigh was undeniable. A grateful headmistress, a relieved class teacher... A
small victory, a moment of pure joy.
But then, the tour began. And our smiles turned to shock, then to a profound, aching
sadness that settled deep in our hearts.
We stepped into the P1 classroom, meant for 18 eager young minds. What we found
was unimaginable. This single, incomplete room, with its bare dirt floor and just four
rough benches made from logs – benches that would surely hurt a child’s back – served
not only as a learning space but also as the staff room for 11 teachers. Tucked behind
the door, a makeshift shelf overflowed with papers, topped incongruously with two
deflated soccer balls. This was the Headmistress's "office," a low-level table and a hard
wooden chair. And in another corner, sacks of maize flour, beans, and three cartons of
soda sat, turning the classroom into the school's food storage. The thought of children
trying to learn, teachers trying to prepare lessons, and a Headmistress trying to manage
a school in such a cramped, multi-purpose, and undignified space was heartbreaking.
The horror continued. The P3 classroom, we discovered, doubled as the school kitchen.
A huge pile of firewood dominated one corner. A few plastic plates and cups, clearly not
enough for 175 children, lay on a tarpaulin on the dirt floor. Soot marks stained the walls
around a makeshift cooking area, with discarded jerricans littering the side. We pictured
the smoke, the heat, the constant disruption to learning. In another corner, a pile of
children’s bags – woven baskets, really – held their few precious books, some with a
single container or two for their meagre meals. Above us, an incomplete ceiling stared
down, and wooden window frames, too few to fill all the openings, offered little
protection against the elements or intruders.
Then came the P4 classroom. Our hearts truly broke here. No windows, no doors, a dirt
floor, no ceiling. The roof was only partially complete, offering a mere suggestion of
shelter from sun or rain. Broken blackboards stood as silent witnesses to interrupted
lessons. Five dilapidated, makeshift seats attached to desks, again made from raw logs,
looked more like crude furniture from a local drinking spot than a place for children to

learn. These were meant for 28 students but were clearly insufficient. How could a child
study, how could they even write an exam, at such a desk? The indignity was crushing.
The tour revealed deeper systemic failures. There were no latrine facilities at the
school. We wondered where the pupils, especially the young girls who need this dignity
most during their monthly periods and who cannot even afford sanitary towels, went to
ease themselves. The teachers, we learned, walked five hundred meters uphill to a
dilapidated latrine at a nearby Catholic church. There was no running water within the
school grounds; water was fetched from a borehole over 1 kilometre down the valley.
We saw pupils walking barefoot, their uniforms so old, worn, and torn that it was painful
to witness.
The lack of basic resources extended to learning aids. No electricity, no printers, no
electronic devices. Teachers had to rely on well-wishers to transport and print
end-of-term exams from Rukungiri town. The school had no atlas, leaving us to imagine
how geography was taught; perhaps from memory, prone to error. Crucially, there was
no dictionary in the entire school. Our hearts sank when we saw the word "Magnet"
misspelled as "mangnent" on a science teacher's board in the P7 classroom – a small
detail that spoke volumes about the daily struggle to access basic reference tools.
The teachers, the very backbone of this struggling institution? They had been unpaid
for over 5 months. Yet, day after day, they returned, driven by an unwavering
commitment to these children. A quick inquiry revealed that the meagre fees paid by
pupils (UGX 28,000 per term), which many families couldn't even afford, were
insufficient to sustain the school or pay salaries. They too relied on well-wishers. Even
the 50,000 that was left behind by one of our colleagues wasn’t enough to cover the
salary dues of the school cook who continuously reminded us that her needs are also
overwhelming and should not be forgotten.
Despite this overwhelming despair, a flicker of hope remained. The dedication of the
PTA, the School Management Committee, and the parents, enduring immense
hardships, was inspiring. The teachers' resilience, showing up daily despite being
unpaid, was a testament to their profound commitment.
The "A Bright Future Begins with a Book" pilot, while a success for the 15 children who
received materials, was a stark awakening. It showed us that while books are a start,
the very foundation of education is crumbling for countless children in places like
Murambo Catholic Nursery and Primary School. If a simple pencil and a past paper
could bring such joy and a glimmer of hope, imagine the transformative power of a safe
classroom, clean water, dignified sanitation, and supported teachers.

This is not an isolated incident. Across Uganda, several schools face similar, unseen
struggles. We must not let this talent go to waste. The success of our pilot, coupled with
the profound needs uncovered, compels us to act on a larger scale. We are driven to
expand our holistic support to three other equally deserving, marginalized schools
across Uganda. We believe that by addressing these fundamental barriers, we can
ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has the chance to truly build a
bright future. We invite you to join us in this urgent and vital mission.

Two Journeys, One Heartbreak: Reflections from Murambo
Catholic Nursery and Primary School
Eric's Reflection: A World Unveiled
I’m Eric, 26, from Ngora district, but Kampala raised me. My childhood was in the city,
with schools that, while not perfect, had walls, roofs, and proper desks. I thought I
understood "poverty" and "marginalized communities" from reports, from news. But
nothing, absolutely nothing, prepared me for Murambo Catholic Nursery and Primary
School.
When we arrived, the children's smiles as they received their books, their little faces
lighting up with the promise of a future, it was pure, unadulterated joy. I felt a swell of
pride, thinking, "Yes, this is why we do what we do."
Then came the tour. And with every step, my heart felt like it was being squeezed tighter
and tighter. The P1 classroom… I just stood there, staring. It wasn't just a classroom; it
was their whole world – a classroom, a staff room for eleven teachers, the
Headmistress's tiny office, and even a food store. A dirt floor. Log benches that looked
like they'd splinter your spine. And the Headmistress, with papers spilling from a
makeshift shelf, two soccer balls on top, trying to run a school from behind a door. My
mind just couldn't reconcile it. “Is this… is this really a school?” I remember whispering
to James, my voice barely audible. It felt like a scene from a forgotten era, not
something happening today.
Moving to the P3 classroom, seeing the pile of firewood, the soot-stained walls, the few
plastic plates on a tarpaulin on the ground – it was a kitchen. Their learning space was
a kitchen. The children’s woven basket bags, holding their few precious books, were so
small, so humble. My own school bag was always bursting with textbooks, notebooks, a
lunch box. Here, it was a struggle for even the basics.
And the P4 classroom… oh, the P4 classroom. No windows, no doors, no ceiling, just a
partial roof. Broken blackboards. Five rickety log desks that looked like they belonged in
a local bar, not a place where children were meant to learn, to dream. I felt tears welling
up, hot and stinging. “How can they even sit here, let alone learn? How can they write
an exam on this?” The injustice of it was a physical ache in my chest. I thought of my
comfortable university lecture halls, the quiet libraries, the endless resources. These
children, just as bright, just as deserving, had none of it.

The lack of latrines, the 1km trek for water, the barefoot children with tattered uniforms –
it was a relentless assault on my senses, each detail chipping away at my composure.
When I saw the misspelled "Magnet" on the blackboard, a simple word, it wasn’t funny;
it was heartbreaking. It was a cry for a dictionary, for basic tools, for the dignity of
knowing. And the teachers, five months without pay, still showing up, still trying to
teach… I just wanted to hug them, to tell them they were heroes. “They come here
every day? Without pay? That’s… that’s incredible,” I remember saying, my voice thick
with emotion.
Being involved in this campaign, I thought it was about giving. But it was about receiving
a brutal, beautiful lesson. It’s a privilege I never truly understood, to have had a proper
education, to have had a choice. This activity, this raw encounter, means everything to
me now. It's not just a project; it's a moral imperative. It showed me that my comfortable
upbringing, my city life, shielded me from a reality that is still very much alive for so
many. The value it brought was a shattering of my ignorance, a deepening of my
empathy that feels like a wound, but a necessary one.
I learned that problems are rarely simple. You deliver books, but the children are
dropping out because they can’t afford fees, because there’s no toilet, because their
teachers are starving. It’s a tangled web of interconnected struggles. And the
resilience… the sheer, unwavering resilience of those children and teachers. It’s a
power I’ve never seen. From this, I will carry a new lens. I will question more, look
deeper, and never take for granted the basic dignities that enable learning and growth.
My journey from a comfortable Kampala childhood to a university student now feels like
a responsibility, a call to be a voice for those children, to fight for the foundations they
deserve.
James's Reflection: Echoes of a Distant Past
I’m James, 27, from Bushenyi. When I heard about Murambo, a part of me braced
myself. Bushenyi has its pockets of deep poverty, and though I didn't grow up in those
exact circumstances, I’ve glimpsed them in my much earlier childhood. I’ve seen the
worn uniforms, the children walking miles barefoot. So, when we arrived, and the 15
PLE candidates greeted us with those eager smiles, I felt a familiar pang – a mix of
hope for them and a quiet dread for what we might find.
Handing out the paper banks and scholastic materials, I saw their eyes, shining with
that desperate hope for a chance. It was beautiful, truly. But as we walked through the
school, it wasn't a shock in the same way it was for Eric. For me, it was a painful
recognition, a chilling echo. “This is exactly what I remember from some of the village
schools when I was a kid,” I found myself saying, my voice low, almost to myself. “It’s
like nothing has changed.”

The P1 classroom, serving as everything from a learning space to a staff room and food
store, with its dirt floor and crude log benches… it was a scene I’d seen before, in
fleeting glimpses. The makeshift Headmistress’s office behind the door, the overflowing
papers – it spoke of ingenuity born of desperation. It hurt to see it, knowing that
decades later, children are still enduring this.
The P3 classroom, a kitchen with its pile of firewood and inadequate plastic plates, was
a familiar sight from my early memories of rural life. The soot marks, the jerricans, the
children’s woven basket bags – it was all too real. It’s a constant battle for these
communities, where every space must serve multiple purposes just to keep things
going.
And the P4 classroom, with no windows, no doors, a partial roof, and those broken,
log-like desks… that’s where the tears came. Not a sudden gush, but a slow, steady
stream, a deep ache. I remembered the stories, the struggles. To think these children
are still trying to learn, to write their exams, on those surfaces, exposed to the elements.
“This is not how a child should learn,” I murmured, shaking my head, a profound
sadness washing over me. It felt like a wound from my own past, reopened.
The lack of latrines, the distant borehole, the barefoot children, the threadbare uniforms
– these weren't just details; they were the fabric of a life I narrowly escaped. The
science teacher's misspelled "Magnet" on the board, the absence of basic dictionaries
and atlases – it’s a symptom of a system that has forgotten its most vulnerable. And the
teachers, five months without pay, still showing up… “How do they do it? How do they
keep coming?” I asked, my voice cracking, knowing the immense sacrifice that entails.
It’s a dedication that breaks your heart and fills it with awe all at once.
Being involved in this campaign felt like a homecoming, in a way. It was a chance to
give back to the kind of communities that shaped my broader understanding of Uganda,
even if I didn't live their exact struggles. The activity itself, delivering those books, was a
small act of kindness, but the revelation of the deeper needs was immense. It showed
me that the fight is far from over.
This experience means a profound connection to my roots, a recognition of the systemic
issues that persist. It means that HGSI’s work is not just charity; it’s justice. The value it
brought was a renewed sense of urgency, a confirmation that the "1K Project" and
broader infrastructural support aren't just good ideas; they are absolutely essential, a
direct response to the very real pain we witnessed. It’s about building the foundations
that were missing for me, and are still missing for them.
I learned that while progress is made, the deepest wounds of poverty and inequality
heal slowly, if at all, without sustained, comprehensive intervention. The resilience of

those children and teachers, enduring unimaginable conditions, is a testament to the
human spirit’s capacity to hope, even in despair. From this, I will carry a more grounded
understanding of the challenges, a deeper commitment to long-term solutions, and a
fierce determination to ensure that no child has to learn on a log, or walk a kilometer for
water, or suffer the indignity of no latrine. My journey, from glimpsing these struggles as
a child to now, as an adult, is a call to action, a lifelong commitment to being part of the
change.
