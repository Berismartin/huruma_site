      "It started, as so many profound things do, with a simple, almost forgotten place: Murambo village. Our family's roots there had seemed to wither after we lost loved ones. But a casual family chat, a reunion in a WhatsApp group, sparked a question that refused to be silenced: What about the family we didn't know?",
      "That question led to action, beginning with the local primary school. There were only seven P7 students, desperate for scholastic materials and revision guides. We dipped into our own pockets, a small gesture that yielded a huge return: the undeniable sparkle of hope in those children's eyes.",
      "We knew then, with absolute clarity, this couldn't be a one-off. It had to be bigger. It had to be sustainable. So, we registered a social enterprise, establishing the foundational structure to scale our initial impact responsibly."
